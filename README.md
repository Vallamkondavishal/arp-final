# ASSIGNMENT1 (5071089 VISHAL VALLAMKONDA)

**AIM**

TO design and code different integer calculator which must excute atleast 4 operations also with arthmetic expressions and the calculator my be bomastic but must be simplified skeleton of real complex. With two version:
vrsion A- communication between processes uses unnamed pipes
version B- communication between processes uses named pipes

**MODULES THAT NEED TO BE INSTALLED**
pip3 install pipe && pip3 install os-sys && pip3 install process

**EXCUTION OF CODE**
Once the libraries are installed, run the script using python3 a1.py


**ABOUT THE CODE**

Here, we will create a simple calculator program in C which will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder depending on the input from the user.
Users will have the choice to choose the operation. If the user chooses the wrong operation then it will get an error message.
Prerequisites for writing a simple calculator program in C:- Switch case in C programming, Programs on switch case in C


The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder operator %% is used in the first printf() function.

The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen.

If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.
